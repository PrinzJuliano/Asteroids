THANKS FOR PLAYING THIS GAME!

PLEASE READ THE LICENSE TEXT!

What is this folder?

This is the asset folder for the game.
In here, all the required files for this game to work are stored.

What is what?

1. config

colors.json:

The colors.json is responsible for the display colors!
Every entry has r, g, b, and a values which represent Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha of the color. Google "color picker" to find some nice colors.

graphics.json:

Here you can toggle the shader settings and smoothing settings!
Shaders require a beefy graphics card!
You can toggle them with "true" or "false".

The smoothing level can be 0, 2, 4, 8, 16.

If you want the default settings then you only need to delete the config folder and start the game again!

2. fonts
Here are the fancy old school like fonts like the Atari and Vector Font.

3.  highscores
Here is the top 5 list of players!
Don't edit it! That would be nasty!!!!!

4. shaders
Here are the shader files!
Sources are in the files them self!
They're not compiled and deleting the folder will not recover them!
Don't change a thing unless you really know what you are doing!
Those shaders have no gameplay impact or what so ever!
You can toggle them in the graphics config file[1].

This is all you need to know!

I want to thank Daniel Shiffman for creating good tutorials and funny videos!
