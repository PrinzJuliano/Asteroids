## What is this?

Have you ever played [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) or seen it as pop culture reference?

My goal was to recreate some of it's glory!

These are aspects of it:

1. Use Java (in this case Processing) with OpenGL.
2. Make the Game flexible.
3. Put some retro shaders on.
4. Make it highly configurable.
